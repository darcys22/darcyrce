I am a self taught developer who is trying to get into a Malware analyst position somewhere. I have been finding that without a degree or previous experience getting into IT is a little tricky (Without starting at the bottom and crawling the career ladder :/).
<br>
<br>
I have a fair bit of programming experience. Areas I consider myself adept in:
<br>
* Ruby/Rails
<br>
* Networking
<br>
* Unix
<br>
* ASM
<br>
<br>

I have made this page because I want to build my Reverse Engineering Portfolio. I'm going to make a post for every CrackMe I do (and whatever else I find relevent). I plan to get through a lot here and post it around. 
<br>
<br>
I am also somewhat interested in functional programming, IT Security, Financial Markets Analysis, Crypto, philosophy etc
<br>
<br>
I'm an Australian guy, but I'm travelling so I am currently in Canada. Would love some form of Malware analysist internship or whatever really. Check my contact page for more info
